This module introduces FastAPI, Pydantic, and Playwright to provide a browser interface for a trivial calculator application, which incorporate into the Git/Docker deployment environment.

## Customizations

With the limited time available this week, I chose to introduce myself to the material by adding one of the additional functions from Mod6, Modulo, to the simplified calculator and engage with it at each stage of the new testing scheme.
